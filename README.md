# bookmark-telegram-bot
[WiP] Telegram bot to bookmark URLs for future reading

## Abstract

The idea is to have a bot as a place to dump a link for future reading.

Later you can request a random link from this "backlog" and have an option to mark it read (= remove).

Optionally can have a means to tag links and then select by tag but need to find a way to make this having good usability in terms of chat interface.
